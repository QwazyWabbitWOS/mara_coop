# mara_coop

This is a conversion of maraakate coop from Strosspot & Phatman that adds laser hook, offworld teleports and other features. 
It has been converted to use GameAPI version 3 instead of V4 so it can run under q2proded or r1q2ded.
Use Visual Studio 2019 to build on Windows and use GNU make to build on Linux.
