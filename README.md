# mara_coop

This is a conversion of maraakate coop from Strosspot & Phatman that adds laser hook, offworld teleports and other features. 
It has been converted to use GameAPI version 3 instead of V4 so it can run under q2proded or r1q2ded.
Use Visual Studio 2019 to build on Windows and use GNU make to build on Linux.
Both debug and release builds copy the dll's from the project directories into c:\quake2\coop
by default.
